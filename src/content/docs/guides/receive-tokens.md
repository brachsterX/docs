## Prerequisites

- You have a wallet installed (e.g., <a href="https://rabby.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rabby</a>, <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MetaMask</a>).

## Receive some Holesky testnet Ether

Taiko (Hekla) is currently deployed on Holesky testnet. Check out <a href="https://faucetlink.to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faucetlink.to</a> for a list of Holesky ether faucets!

## Receive some Hekla testnet tokens

HORSE is a dummy testnet token we deployed on Taiko (Hekla). You can see all deployed contracts <a href="/network-reference/addresses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Navigate to the <a href="https://bridge.hekla.taiko.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bridge</a> and click "Faucet" on the sidebar to receive some HORSE.

## Receive some TTKOh

:::note
In order to receive TTKOh you need to have an SGX prover setup. We are working on an easy Docker setup to run the images if you have an SGX machine, and after verifying that you have an SGX machine we can send some TTKOh. Stay tuned for that!
