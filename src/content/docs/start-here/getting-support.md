### Diving deeper into Taiko

There are two main places to look for Taiko's documentation. The user docs which are here, and the developer docs / source code comments inside of our protocol monorepo, <a href="https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-mono" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taiko-mono</a>).
